## Post 1: The Hook (Problem Statement)

**Headline:** Stop Building Salesforce Flows Like It's 1995

Your team writes code in VS Code with Git, PRs, and CI/CD. But Salesforce Flows? Still dragging and dropping in a UI with zero version control.

This needs to change.

Flows should be:
✓ Version-controlled in Git
✓ Reviewed in pull requests
✓ Validated automatically in CI/CD
✓ Deployable with confidence
✓ Readable by AI (yes, really)

We built a tool to make this happen. Check out the full story in the comments.

## Post 2: The Solution (Product Launch)

**Headline:** Introducing mermaid-flow-compiler: Flows as Code

What if you could write Salesforce Flows as simple text diagrams, commit them to Git, and let CI/CD handle the rest?

That's exactly what we've built.

🔧 **The tool:**
- Write flows as Mermaid diagrams (simple, clean syntax)
- Compile to production-ready Salesforce Flow XML
- Validate automatically (catch errors before deploy)
- Generate docs automatically
- Web visualizer with live preview

📊 **The impact:**
- Developers work locally in VS Code
- Teams review flows in pull requests
- DevOps enforce quality gates
- Full audit trail via Git
- AI can analyze and improve flows

🚀 **Status:** Production-ready, MIT licensed, 100+ tests

Ready to bring your flows into the modern era?

## Post 3: The Transformation (Before/After)

**Headline:** The Flow Development Journey We Need to Make

BEFORE (Current Reality):
- Write flow in UI → screenshot it → email team → manual validation → fingers crossed in production

AFTER (With mermaid-flow-compiler):
- Write flow in VS Code → commit to Git → CI validates automatically → PR review → merge → auto-deploy

Same outcome. Completely different experience.

✨ What changes:
- No more UI drag-and-drop (it's code now)
- Code reviews on flows (yes, really)
- Automated testing (before deployment)
- Full Git history (rollback anytime)
- Docs auto-generated
- AI can help improve your flows

This is infrastructure-as-code applied to Salesforce. And it works.

Open source. Production ready. Let's fix this together.

## Post 4: The Demo (Show & Tell)

**Headline:** Building a Salesforce Flow in 3 Minutes (No UI Required)

Here's what Salesforce Flow development looks like when you bring it into the 21st century:

1️⃣ Write a diagram (simple text, Mermaid syntax)
2️⃣ Run one command: `npm run cli -- compile --input flow.mmd --out-flow ./flows`
3️⃣ Get production-ready XML, documentation, and DSL JSON automatically

Your flow is now in Git. Ready for code review, CI/CD validation, and deployment.

The entire pipeline is deterministic—same input = same output. This means:
✓ Clean Git diffs (easy to review)
✓ Reproducible (no surprises in production)
✓ Testable (validate before you deploy)
✓ Mergeable (Git can intelligently resolve conflicts)

This is how modern development should work.

## Post 6: The Moment (Inspiration)

**Headline:** The Day We Stop Fighting Salesforce Flow Builder

For years, we've accepted that Salesforce Flows are trapped in a UI. No version control. No code reviews. No CI/CD. Just... hope it works.

Today, that changes.

mermaid-flow-compiler proves you can treat Salesforce Flows like any other infrastructure. Version-controlled. Tested. Deployed with confidence.

This is what modern development looks like:
- Your code is in Git (with history, reviews, rollbacks)
- Your flows should be too
- Your team should collaborate the same way
- Your pipeline should validate everything automatically

We built the tool. Now it's time for the community to drive it forward.

## Post 7: The Ask (Community)

**Headline:** We Need Your Help (and Your Stars ⭐)

We've been building mermaid-flow-compiler for the past months. It's production-ready, well-tested, and already deployed.

But we can't do this alone.

If you believe Salesforce Flows deserve:
✓ Version control
✓ Code reviews
✓ CI/CD automation
✓ AI analysis
✓ Modern developer experience

Then we'd love your help:

🌟 Star the repo (shows there's demand)
🐛 Report bugs (help us make it bulletproof)
💡 Request features (shape the roadmap)
🤝 Contribute code (join the team)
📢 Share this (tell your network)

This is open-source development. The community drives everything.

Let's build the future of Salesforce together.

## Post 8: The Social Proof (Success Story)

**Headline:** From Manual Validation to Automated Testing in 48 Hours

We deployed mermaid-flow-compiler to production 2 weeks ago. Here's what we learned:

✅ 100+ test cases passing
✅ Real-world flows compile in <1 second
✅ Git diffs are clean and reviewable
✅ CI/CD validation catches errors early
✅ Zero production incidents from flows

But the real win? Our developers are faster and more confident.

They're writing flows locally, committing to Git, and reviewing in pull requests. Just like real code.

This is the standard. This should be the standard for everyone building on Salesforce.

The tool is open source. The barrier to entry is zero. The potential is unlimited.

If you're building on Salesforce, this solves a real problem.

## Post 9: The Shortform (Reels/Short Content)

**60 seconds version:**

"Your Salesforce Flows should be in Git."

That's it. That's the entire thesis.

Today they're trapped in a UI. No version control. No code review. No CI/CD.

We built mermaid-flow-compiler to fix this.

Write flows as code → Commit to Git → Auto-validate → Deploy with confidence

It's production-ready. It's open source. It's time to modernize.

## Post 10: The Evergreen (Wisdom/Thought Leadership)

**Headline:** The Infrastructure-as-Code Revolution Came for Kubernetes. Now It's Coming for Salesforce.

Five years ago, we managed cloud infrastructure through UIs and manual configuration.

Today, we write it as code (Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible). We commit it to Git. We review it in PRs. We validate it in CI/CD.

Salesforce Flows are still in the 2000s.

They should be code too.

This isn't about tools—it's about culture. Modern development means:
- Everything is version-controlled
- Everything is reviewed
- Everything is tested
- Everything is automated
- Everything is reproducible

Salesforce development deserves this standard.

We're building it. The community is growing. And this is just the beginning.
