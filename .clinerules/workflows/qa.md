# QA (Strategy + Test Design)

## Goal
Produce a risk-based QA strategy and concrete test cases (manual + automation candidates).

## Steps
1) Identify system under test + critical user journeys.
2) Create risk matrix (impact x likelihood) and prioritize.
3) Write test plan: environments, data, roles/permissions.
4) Draft test suites: functional, regression, negative, boundary, non-functional.
5) Recommend minimal automation set (smoke + critical flows) without overengineering.

## Deliverables (write to docs/ai/qa/)
- qa-strategy.md
- test-cases.md
- risk-matrix.md
- automation-candidates.md

## Output format
- Markdown + tables (test cases, risk matrix).
- Must include: Entry/Exit Criteria, Test Data Strategy, Defect Triage Rules
