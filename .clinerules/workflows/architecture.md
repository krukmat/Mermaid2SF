# Architecture (Software/System)

## Goal
Produce an architecture proposal that is implementable and reviewable: components, interfaces, decisions, and risks.

## Steps
1) Read current architecture docs / key modules first.
2) Identify constraints (runtime, offline/local-only, security, scaling).
3) Propose target architecture: components + responsibilities + boundaries.
4) Define interfaces/contracts (schemas, APIs, files).
5) Create ADR(s): decisions + alternatives + tradeoffs.

## Deliverables (write to docs/ai/architecture/)
- architecture-overview.md
- interfaces-contracts.md
- adr-0001.md (and more if needed)
- risks-mitigations.md

## Output format
- Markdown; use tables for tradeoffs.
- Must include: Current State, Target State, Migration Plan, Risks, Open Questions
