# Functional Definition (BA)

## Goal
Produce functional definitions suitable for developers: user stories, acceptance criteria, flows, data, and edge cases.

## Steps
1) Inspect relevant docs/specs and current behavior in the repo (read before writing).
2) Draft: scope + assumptions + stakeholders + constraints.
3) Write user stories with clear AC (Given/When/Then).
4) Add functional flows (happy path + exceptions).
5) Add a concise “Developer Notes” section (data, integrations, permissions, non-functional hints).

## Deliverables (write to docs/ai/functional/)
- feature-brief.md
- user-stories.md
- acceptance-criteria.md
- open-questions.md

## Output format
- Markdown
- Must include: Scope, Out of Scope, Assumptions, Risks, Open Questions, Next Actions
